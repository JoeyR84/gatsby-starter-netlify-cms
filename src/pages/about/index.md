### Hello

My name is Joey and I am a frontend JavaScript developer. I have been coding for about a year and a half. For the first year I was working full time and coding on nights and weekends. For about 8 of those months I went through a part-time, online bootcamp (Bloc.io). The last six months I have been studying React, React Native, Apollo + GraphQL, and other new, interesting technologies.

When I am not coding I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, craft breweries, and cooking with my girlfriend, Erin, and my dog, Chalupa Batman.
