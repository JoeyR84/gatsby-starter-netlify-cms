When you think of cooking and coding you may not think of a whole lot of transferable skills or experience (or at least I didn’t). They are kind of on two different ends of the career spectrum. It was a huge step for me to make the transition from cook to coder, and I am quite proud of myself for sticking with it. <!-- end --> Here are some stats to help you picture the difference.



Cook is number 6 on the list of worst jobs, and pays the lowest salary.

Mobile Developer is number 8, and Front End Engineer is number 15 on the list of best jobs!

I spent six years in the kitchen. A majority of the time, It was rough to say the least. I had no real direction in life. I had no passion. I told myself my passion was the kitchen and even contemplated cooking school at one point. But something that makes you unhappy and beats you down is not your passion. Hard work and tolerance for adversity are required skills in the kitchen and I have both. Three out of five cooks don’t show up for work. Ok, get ready to work an extra shift, run around slinging pots and pans until 2 am, break your back, get burned and yelled at, then don’t get thanked. Not a healthy lifestyle. So, I started taking courses on-line for web development just for fun and realized I really enjoyed it. I found myself saying “Could this be my passion? Can I really just learn this and make a change?” It was time to take my hard work, attention to detail, problem solving skills, and determination out of the kitchen and throw them into coding.



\* The Bootcamp



Ok, so I was sure that I wanted to learn to code, but wasn’t sure how to accomplish my goal. Enter Bootcamps! There are a ton of bootcamps out there these days. Bloc.io seemed like a good fit. It’s part-time, flexible, full-stack, and you get a mentor, so I went for it. The adventure began! The same day that I started Bloc, I started a 9–5 at Rowdy Mermaid Kombucha. (I had to get out of the kitchen!) I was bottling kombucha by day and learning to code by night. While I enjoyed working with great people and a great product, a 40+ hour a week job and a 20+ hour a week school commitment got pretty overwhelming. But hey, you gotta eat. If you are familiar with Boulder, Colorado rent prices, then you know it’s not the cheapest place to live. So, what to do? I had told myself I would do literally whatever it took. My lease was nearing an end and I had a decision to make. I couldn’t afford to eat and sleep (under a roof) without working a full time job.



\* House => Truck => Van



The decision was surprisingly easy. I bought an old topper and lived in the bed of my truck for the next three months. That allowed me to work part-time and focus on what I really wanted to do, code. Living in my truck bed obviously was not easy, especially during winter in Colorado. Think…three sleeping bags and a dog as a heater. But, it gave me the opportunity to catch up with school work. I eventually sold the truck, bought a van, and turned it into a proper mobile classroom and mini apartment. Soon after, I graduated from Bloc, quit my job bottling/brewing Kombucha, and bought some udemy courses and began developing an app to continue my education.



\* Conclusion



Making a change is hard. Knowing what you want and being determined to achieve your goals makes it easier. I am living in a house these days. I’m washing dishes and freelance coding to pay the rent, but I am confident in my path and determined as ever. Wish me luck in my job hunt. I hope this article will inspire someone else to commit to their goals or help make a desired change. Thanks for reading!
